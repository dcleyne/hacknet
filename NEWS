New change to the source tree..  this means that we've got lots of
new directories and suchlike!  You'll find the server in the
'server' directory, and the client in the 'ttyclient' directory.
If/when more clients are created, they'll be in their own directories.
the 'client' directory holds the libclient.a library, which you link
to your particular client port.  The ttyclient, for example, uses
curses or ncurses to display the dungeon, but it'd be just as easy
to make a graphical client, or a client that used (for example)
DOS control characters to move the cursor around.

The ttyclient still requires POSIX-compliant threads and either
curses or ncurses.
