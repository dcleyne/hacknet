  Lots of renamed files, to make a more consistant file naming scheme.  Objects now
  have an OBJ prefix, Entities (players, monsters, etc) now have an ENT prefix, and
  Maps now have a MAP prefix.  Core classes still use HN, and network classes still
  use NET.

  Adjusted the hnGame and netServer classes.  The netServer has a pointer to the
  hnGame, which has a pointer to the lower-level guts of the simulation.  Both
  the netServer and the hnGame are singletons (possibly the hnGame shouldn't be
  a singleton -- to be considered for future updates).  This is in preparation
  for migrating the player update logic from the hnGame object into the entPlayer
  object.

  Added hnDungeon class (singleton) to own all the levels in the dungeon.  Again,
  trying to move as much out of the hnGame as possible, in preparation for moving
  the movement code into the entPlayer.

  Continued discussions about timing issues.
  Adjusted object class hierarchy -- 'hnEntity' is now at the top of the hierarchy,
  with 'hnObject' and 'hnCreature' derived from it.  Players and monsters will be
  derived from hnCreature, while inanimate objects will be derived from hnObject.
