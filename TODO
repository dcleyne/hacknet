TODO:

Obviously, this isn't a comprehensive list of things that need doing.  Rather,
it's a list of the next things that need implementing.  More will be added to
the list as current items are removed!  Indented items indicate dependencies --
indented items rely upon the completion of their parent item before they can
be achieved!  (ie: we must have monsters before we can write monster AI)

 - UI work.  (Integrate existing NetHack client code to make our own clients?)
 - Proper character creation (race, class, alignment, etc)
 - Real Monster AI
