HackNet - version 0.0.2

Trevor Powell:  whiterabbit@users.sourceforge.net
-------

HackNet is a multiplayer roguelike game borrowing heavily from the style and
gameplay of Hack and Nethack.  Our goal is to keep the flavour of Hack intact,
despite the gameplay changes required by allowing multiple simultaneous
players.

HackNet is in very early development (as you can see from our version number).
Please see the ChangeLog and the TODO list for project status and playability
information.  See NOTES for project goals and technical guidelines.  See
docs/instructions.txt for playing instructions.


What's New?   (See ChangeLog for details)
-------

New since 0.0.1, communication between players, rudimentary line-of-sight
(rogue-style), multiple dungeon levels, the ability to run the server and
clients on different servers.


Platforms Supported
-------

HackNet has been successfully compiled on:

x86 	- Debian GNU/Linux 2.1, 2.2, & current 'unstable'.
x86 	- FreeBSD 4.2-stable
x86 	- Cygwin (under Windows)
Alpha 	- RedHat Linux 7.0
PPC 	- Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
Sparc	- Debian GNU/Linux 2.2

Known problems exist for the following platforms:
Compaq Tru64
Sun Solaris

... more, as they're reported to me!  If you get it to compile on something
that isn't listed here, or get it compiling on one of the currently unworking
platforms, or have a lead on how to get it working, please let me know!  
Please submit any patches to me at:

Installing from a source package:
-------

Run ./configure, then type 'make' to make the hacknet server and client.
'make install' should install them somewhere sensible, but it's probably
easier to just run them straight out of the src directory -- that's what
I do!

Installing from CVS sources:
-------

Run ./autogen.sh to create and execute a standard configure script.  Then
type 'make' to make the hacknet server and client.  'make install' should
install them somewhere sensible, but it's probably easier to just run them
straight out of the src directory -- that's what I do!



Running HackNet:
--------

As mentioned under 'installing', I recommend running HackNet directly
from the src directory at the moment, so cd into that directory.

On the server machine, run the hacknetd binary.  You should receive
several screenfulls of debugging output as five dungeon levels are
constructed.

On the client, run the hacknet binary, passing the server address
as the final command line argument.  Hacknet will use your user
name as your player name, unless you give it a different name with
the -u option.

Example:  To connect to a server on the local computer with the
name 'Foo', use the following command line:

./hacknet -uFoo localhost


Caveats:
--------

Note that currently the HackNet client is hard-wired to connect to a server
running on port 9274, and the server is hard-wired to use that port.  Is
there any demand to allow it to use an arbitrary port?  I should probably
stop being lazy and make it possible.

Note that currently quite a lot of data gets transferred to the client
when changing levels -- ~7k, which can take some amount of time on modem
connects.  Minimizing data that must be transferred is going to be a major 
goal for the next version.
