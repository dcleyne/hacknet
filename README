HackNet - version 0.0.1
-------

HackNet is a multiplayer roguelike game borrowing heavily from the style and
gameplay of Hack and Nethack.  Our goal is to keep the flavour of Hack intact,
despite the gameplay changes required by allowing multiple simultaneous
players.

HackNet is in very early development (as you can see from our version number).
Please see the ChangeLog and the TODO list for project status and playability
information.  See NOTES for project goals and technical guidelines.


Installation information:
-------

Run ./autogen.sh to create and execute a standard configure script.  Then
type 'make' to make the hacknet server and client.  'make install' should
install them somewhere sensible, but it's probably easier to just run them
straight out of the src directory -- that's what I do!

'hacknetd' is the server, 'hacknet' is the curses/pthread-based TTY client.
Run hacknetd first, then up to ten copies of hacknet.

Caveats:
--------

Note that currently the HackNet client is hard-wired to connect to a server
running on localhost, and to connect through port 9274.  All it'll take to
allow real networked connections between separate computers is some command 
line argument parsing..  but until the game is more playable, I can't be 
stuffed to actually write this segment of code.  ;)
